## Description

Based on example 4, creates and positions the player and obstacles using preloads and loadJSON files. Once the level is complete a new level with a different grid and dyanmically placed obstacles loads.

---

## Setup and Interaction Instructions

- The game will load level one
- Use WASD or the arrow keys to move the blue circle in any direction
- Once the blue circle reaches the yellow square the level is complete
- The next level will automatically load when level one is complete

---

## Iteration Notes

Post-Playtest

- Changed the grid, position of obstacles, circle, and finish line for level 2
- Ommitted the use of dynamically placed obstacles as it caused issues with the code
- If the player hits the orange obstacle it brings them back to the starting position

Post-Showcase

- I would add movement to the game by making the obstacles move in the players way during the level to add challenge
- Allow players to press and hold the key so they do not have to repeatedly press a key to move ensuring user-friendliness
